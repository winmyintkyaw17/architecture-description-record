## Title
Use of NativeScript Vue for Mobile App Development

## Context
Our project requires the development of a mobile application with a Vue.js frontend framework. We need to decide on the appropriate technology stack for building the mobile app, considering factors such as developer familiarity, ecosystem support, and performance.

## Decision
We have decided to use NativeScript Vue for mobile app development, leveraging the capabilities of Vue.js combined with the native performance of NativeScript.

## Rationale
We choose NativeScript Vue because it allows us to build native mobile apps using Vue.js, a frontend framework familiar to our development team. This enables us to take advantage of the rich ecosystem and community support of Vue.js for building the frontend of our mobile app. Additionally, NativeScript Vue provides direct access to native APIs and device features, ensuring a seamless user experience while maintaining high performance standards.

## Consequences
- **Pros:**
  - Development becomes easier as we can leverage our existing Vue.js skills and reuse components.
  - Access to native features enhances the functionality and user experience of the app.
  - Integration with Vue.js simplifies the development process and reduces the learning curve for the team.
- **Cons:**
  - Learning curve for team members who are new to NativeScript Vue.
  - Platform-specific optimizations or features may require additional effort.
  - While NativeScript Vue offers high performance, there may be a slight overhead compared to building purely native apps.

## Sample Code
```vue
<template>
    <Page>
        <ActionBar title="Home" />
        <StackLayout>
            <Label text="Welcome to NativeScript Vue!" />
        </StackLayout>
    </Page>
</template>

<script>
export default {
    name: "Home",
};
</script>

<style scoped>
/* Add your component styles here */
</style>
