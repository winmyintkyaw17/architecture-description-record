## Title
Integration of NativeScript for Cross-Platform Mobile App Development

## Context
Our project requires the development of a mobile application that needs to run seamlessly on both iOS and Android platforms. We are faced with the challenge of choosing a framework that allows us to achieve native-like performance while leveraging our existing web development skills.

## Decision
We have decided to integrate NativeScript into our project for cross-platform mobile app development.

## Rationale
We choose NativeScript because it provides a robust solution for building truly native mobile apps using familiar web technologies like JavaScript, TypeScript, or Angular. This allows our development team to reuse existing skills and codebase, reducing the learning curve and development time. Additionally, NativeScript provides direct access to native device features, ensuring a rich user experience while maintaining high performance standards across platforms.

## Consequences
- **Pros:**
  - Development becomes easier as we can write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android platforms.
  - Access to native features enhances the user experience and functionality of the app.
  - Leveraging existing web skills reduces the learning curve for the team.
- **Cons:**
  - Platform-specific optimizations or features may require additional effort.
  - Team members who are new to NativeScript may require some time to familiarize themselves with the framework.
  - While NativeScript offers high performance, there may be a slight overhead compared to building purely native apps.

## Sample Code
```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { NativeScriptCamera } from "@nativescript/camera";

@Component({
    selector: "app-camera",
    template: `
        <Button text="Take Picture" (tap)="takePicture()"></Button>
    `
})
export class CameraComponent {
    constructor() {}

    takePicture() {
        NativeScriptCamera.requestPermissions().then(
            () => {
                NativeScriptCamera.takePicture().then(
                    (imageAsset) => {
                        console.log("Image taken: " + imageAsset);
                    },
                    (error) => {
                        console.log("Error taking picture: " + error);
                    }
                );
            },
            () => {
                console.log("Permission denied");
            }
        );}}
